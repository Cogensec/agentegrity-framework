"""Integrity layers shipped with the framework.

The default integrity pipeline composes four layers:

    AdversarialLayer  → self-defense (coherence under adversarial pressure)
    CorticalLayer     → self-stability (reasoning, memory, drift)
    GovernanceLayer   → policy enforcement, human oversight, audit
    RecoveryLayer     → self-recovery (compromise detection, continuity)

Use :func:`default_layers` to construct the full default pipeline. Both
:class:`agentegrity.AgentegrityClient` and :class:`agentegrity.adapters.base._BaseAdapter`
delegate to it so every "zero-config" entry point evaluates the same
four layers.
